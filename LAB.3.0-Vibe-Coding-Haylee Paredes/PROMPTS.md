What I Asked AI:

PART 1:

1st Attempt - “Can you build me a complete, working dice game that runs in a web browser.
Make it a single HTML file that I just open and use. Include all the JavaScript and CSS needed.
The dice game needs to roll two dice, display the results, and keep score. Build a simple
interactive web application.”

2nd Attempt Change - “When I open the application, everything looks great, but it won't show
the dice. I attached a screenshot and circled it in white.”

3rd Attempt Change - “So the auto roll is too fast. Can you fix that to go slower?”

PART 2:

1st Attempt - “Rebuild my dice game as a Single Page Application using Vanilla. The dice game
needs to roll two dice, display the results, and keep score. Create a complete working version I
can test. Explain what's different about using Vanilla for this. I know you can do better on how
the dice look. Can you make everything look nicer?”

2nd Attempt Change - “I can see the dice, but they are kinda hard to see though.”

3rd Attempt Change - “I can see the dice, but they are kinda hard to see though. They blend into
the background. The Mat and Dice drop-down option I can barely see. Only when my cursor
hovers over it, it highlights it can then I can read the options.”

4th Attempt Change - “Can you make it so that the dark mode viewing of the dice game is the
same in light mode. I want light mode to look like the dark mode dice game. I want the mat
drop-down box & dice drop-down box right next to the clear round box.”

What Worked About the AI’s Response:

PART 1:

1st Attempt - It created the initial build for the assignment.

2nd Attempt Change - Well, it fixed the look of the dice, which was exactly what I wanted.

3rd Attempt Change - It fixed the speed of the auto roll for the dice.

PART 2:

1st Attempt - It created the initial build for part two of the assignment.

2nd Attempt Change - It made the web app properly show the dice more clearly.

3rd Attempt Change - It made the web app properly show the dice mat and dice customization
options clearly.

4th Attempt Change - It made the light mode version of the game match the dark mode version
of the game.

What Didn’t Work About the AI’s Response:

PART 1:

1st Attempt - The dice didn’t show up when the application opened.

2nd Attempt Change - The speed of the auto roll was way too fast.

PART 2:

1st Attempt - The dice were very hard to see when the app opened.

2nd Attempt Change - When asked to fix the dice, it changed, but instead blended in with the
background.

3rd Attempt Change - There were dice and mat customization options, but you could barely see
the drop-down box options.

4th Attempt Change - The light mode and dark mode options based on system theme/mode were
not working or clashing, and it needed to be fixed, as well as making the dice and mat boxes be
aligned with the reset button, roll button, and target box.

What I Learned:

I learned that AI can make mistakes, but if you ask AI to fix things for you more efficiently, then
ask questions in shorter prompts. I feel like that is not exactly a good thing to learn, but if you’re
someone who uses AI a lot, it may be useful.
