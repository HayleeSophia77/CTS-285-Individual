# DataMon Specifications

This is a recap -- we're putting everything about the original Dataman in one place for reference.
Also we're changing the name to "DataMon".

## The Dataman Project

For the midterm project, your group is implementing a Python console (text only) application that mimics several features of the original Dataman calculator.

These features are, in order of priority:
* Answer Checker
* Memory Bank
* Number Guesser
* Any additional feature from the manual
* Any other feature you come up with

Some adaptation is required. For instance, the original Memory Bank had a parent input math problems for the child to solve later -- you could decide to instead have the program generate random problems. Your judgement will be required for how to best adapt the original features into your program. Some of the extra features that require multiple players or a timer are probably beyond the scope of this project, but some of them are workable.

The section "Hints for Parents and Teachers" in the PDF gives an idea of the customer expectations of how this program should work. 

You have already written the user stories for this program. In Module Three we'll begin to use the Agile process to run the development teams to write the actual program.

My expectation is that you will be able to get Answer Checker working in the first 2 week iteration, and Memory Bank in the second. Ideally you'll get Number Guesser working by then as well.
