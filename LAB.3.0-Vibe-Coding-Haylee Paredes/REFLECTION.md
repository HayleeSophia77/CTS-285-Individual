The AI as Collaborator:

The thing that AI helped with most was when I tried to get my dice game up and running
in the beginning. The AI provided a full HTML, CSS, and JavaScript file that actually ran in the
browser. Also, it helped me understand how parts of the program went together, such as how the
buttons trigger JavaScript functions and how the faces of the dice were shown using CSS grids.
The AI frustrated me most when I asked it to fix or slow down parts of the animation. It
sometimes broke something else in its effort to fix one problem. The thing that I was surprised
about was how specific my prompt had to be because small word changes made quite a big
difference in understanding the task at hand.

The Framework Experiment:

The AI suggested the recreation of my dice game as a single-page application using React
because it's widely used to handle user interface updates and content refreshes without requiring
a page load. When I actually tried to make the SPA version, I noticed it was more complicated
than I had thought it would be. The regular version of my dice game was way simpler since
everything was in one HTML file that I could just open and play. For my game, the original
version felt better because it was easy to test, change, and understand. However, I can see how an
SPA would make more sense for a bigger project that has multiple pages or lots of data updates. If I were building something larger, I would probably use React or another framework to keep
the project more organized and scalable.

The “Vibe Coding Ceiling”:

I did end up reaching a point where the AI couldn't further help me, especially when I
tried to understand why certain parts of the SPA didn't run correctly. It kept giving suggestions
that didn't match what was happening in my code, and that's when I realized I needed to actually
learn what each section of the JavaScript was doing. I started reading through the code more
slowly and figuring out how the functions and events connected. That process helped me see that
AI can build something that works, but I still have to understand how to fix or customize it.
Something I would do differently is I would take more notes as I go and ask the AI to explain its
code line by line before moving on. That would help me understand more instead of just testing
until it works.

Growth Moment:

This project has taught me that such AI tools are great at speeding up the building
process, but they don't replace understanding. I learned how to effectively communicate with an
AI by asking for all the details and checking over its work. It also showed me that web
development isn't just writing code, it's about problem-solving, testing, and understanding how
different parts fit together. I gained more confidence in reading HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,
even though I didn't know all the details at first. Now, I'm interested in how things work behind
the scenes with things like React and why they are better for larger-scale applications. One thing that I wonder now is: how do professional developers decide when to use plain JavaScript versus using a framework for their projects?
