# CTS-285, Systems Analysis &amp; Design
AlgoCratic Futures™ is an immersive educational experience that teaches software development through satirical corporate simulation. Students navigate a fictional dystopian workplace while learning real technical skills and professional competencies. The theatrical elements create psychological safety through absurdism—the goal is that when students encounter actual workplace challenges, they'll think "this isn't as difficult as AlgoCratic Futures" and approach problems with confidence and resilience.

This course balances entertainment with rigorous skill development. The satirical corporate dystopia serves as a vehicle for stress inoculation, teaching students to thrive under pressure while maintaining technical standards. Students learn to navigate contradictory requirements, changing specifications, and resource constraints—exactly the challenges they'll face in professional software development environments.
